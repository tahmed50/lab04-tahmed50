Given a C function which returns the factorial of an input x, what is the largest x 
that produces a correct answer, and what is the value of that factorial, 
assuming the return type of the function is: 

1. char? 5!=120 [The first one is done for you to demonstrate what I'm looking for.]
2. unsigned char?
3. short?
4. unsigned short?
5. int?
6. unsigned int?
7. long?
8. unsigned long?

9. Can the unsigned version of any integer type ever have a bigger x than the signed version?
   
10. If the unsigned version can have a bigger x, show an example where this is true. If not, why not?
